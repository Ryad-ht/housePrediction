i get my data from kaggle there https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammadbinimran/housing-price-prediction-data

i am going to work on R because i am in a classe right now and i prefer to learn with usful project 

I am starting to read all my data with usful methode so i can understant what my data look like 
this library is very usful Tidyvers so i am going to use it

i cant sapply(data, function(x) sum(is.na(x))) use this beacuase x ist numerique value thay are talking about neighboorhood

a lot of posibiliter can be use 
skip this part
replace theme by numbers like 1 2 or 3
or creating more collumn bcs ther are only 3 thing and we will for ech will be a boolean (good thing to do bcs iam a data analyst creating restriction (if its urban it can be rural ect))so for the next time ppl want to entry a new valu tey can do mistak (at least less mistak)
